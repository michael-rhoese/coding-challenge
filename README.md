# Idea
Create a Webapp that allows the generation of a HTML table. The data and the configuration can also be managed by the Webapp.
Required use-cases are described in the diagram.

__3 Teams a 2 Devs__ - _Let's see what the outcome is_ ;)

## Possible configuration options

- With/without table head
- Column count
- Row count
- Highlighted row
- Colors

## HTML Generator implementation
The implementation is not required and is only used for testing. But you are totally free to implement it ;)

## ACs
- REST API is implemented and tested
- REST API is documented
